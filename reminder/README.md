# Reminder 
This code prompts the user to input a date, time, and task. It then converts this input into a datetime object and checks the current time against this reminder time every minute. When the current time reaches the specified reminder time, it notifies the user about the task.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not cover all scenarios (such as error handling for incorrect input). You can further enhance it by adding error handling, allowing the user to input in different date/time formats, or providing more sophisticated reminders (e.g., sending an email or a notification).

Remember, running this code will depend on your Python environment setup and may require adjustments based on your specific needs.
